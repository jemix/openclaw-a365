/**
 * Module-level singleton for the A365 plugin runtime.
 *
 * This pattern is used because the OpenClaw plugin system initializes plugins
 * once and the runtime needs to be accessible from various modules (token.ts,
 * graph-tools.ts, etc.) without passing it through every function call.
 *
 * Trade-offs:
 * - Simple to use throughout the codebase
 * - Makes unit testing harder (use resetA365Runtime in tests)
 * - Not suitable for multiple plugin instances (not a current requirement)
 *
 * Alternative approaches for future consideration:
 * - Dependency injection container
 * - AsyncLocalStorage for request-scoped runtime
 * - Factory pattern with explicit runtime parameter
